# React migration cleanup — master plan

Branch: `ajax/react-migration-cleanup`
Started: 2026-07-18

Follow-on to react slices S1–S7 (`docs/react-migration-plan.md`), which landed
behavioral parity. This program covers the cleanup, structure, lifecycle,
shadcn, a11y, and performance work that S1–S7 deliberately deferred.

## Scope

Twelve independently validated slices, each its own PR, each validated on a real
iPhone before the PR is opened.

## Non-goals

- No redesign. Visual identity, iOS Safari behavior, backend contracts, terminal
  behavior, and task-lifecycle ownership are preserved.
- No new state library (Redux/Zustand/TanStack Query). `architecture.md` forbids
  a browser-side source of truth.
- No renderer replacement. xterm 6.0 + fit addon stay.
- No default shadcn appearance. Semantic tokens map onto existing Ajax tokens.

## Ground truth established before planning

| Fact | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| No ESLint exists in the repo — no dep, no config | `package.json` devDependencies; no `eslint.config.*` anywhere |
| The two `eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` comments suppress a linter that never runs | `crates/ajax-web/web/src/components/App.tsx:193,209` |
| A second JS chunk is a hard build failure | `scripts/web-build-check.mjs:38` (`expected exactly dist/app.js`), plus explicit `dist/terminal.js` and preload bans at `:44,:64` |
| `legacyTerminalRemoval.test.ts` `.svelte` paths are intentional absence guards, not stale references | `crates/ajax-web/web/src/legacyTerminalRemoval.test.ts:9-40` — asserts the files do **not** exist |
| Zero Svelte source files, deps, or plugins remain | `find`/`grep` sweep; `package.json` has no svelte entries |
| Live Svelte references are prose/config only | `architecture.md:712-729`, `TERMINAL*.md`, `install.rs` comments, 4 e2e comments, 4 src comments, `tsconfig.json:23` |

## Slices

Each slice: plan file → tests first → focused validation → full web gate →
dev deploy → iPhone checklist → **wait for Matt** → PR.

| # | Slice | Plan file | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Svelte + documentation cleanup | `react-cleanup-s1-svelte-docs.md` | in progress |
| 2 | ESLint toolchain + dependency boundaries | `react-cleanup-s2-eslint.md` | not started |
| 3 | `useHashRoute` → `useSyncExternalStore` | — | not started |
| 4 | Cockpit/version/task resource hooks (`RemoteResource<T>`) | — | not started |
| 5 | Strict Mode lifecycle safety | — | not started |
| 6 | shadcn foundation + Button | — | not started |
| 7 | Dialog/Sheet + NewTaskSheet | — | not started |
| 8 | RadioGroup + remaining low-risk primitives | — | not started |
| 9 | App composition cleanup (feature folders) | — | not started |
| 10 | Terminal-controller extraction | — | not started |
| 11 | Bundle / code-splitting investigation | — | not started |
| 12 | Remaining audit findings | — | not started |

## Slice ordering rationale

Ordering differs from a naive read of the request in one place, deliberately:

- **Slice 2 (ESLint) precedes every behavioral slice** so the hooks rules are
  failing loudly *before* slices 3–5 change effect code. Adding the linter after
  the effect rewrites would let the rewrites define the baseline.
- **Slice 9 (feature-folder moves) lands after slices 3–8**, not first. Moving
  files and changing their contents in the same slice makes every diff unreviewable.
  Boundaries are enforced by ESLint from slice 2; the physical moves come once
  the contents have stopped changing.
- **Slice 11 is investigation-first.** See the risk below.

## Known risks

1. **Code splitting vs. the embed contract (slice 11).** `web-build-check.mjs`
   and the Rust asset adapter both assume exactly one JS file with a fixed name.
   Lazy-loading xterm is not a Vite config tweak — it needs deterministic chunk
   names, an amended build check, an amended Rust adapter, and a new assertion
   that every emitted asset is embedded and served. If the evidence does not
   justify that, slice 11 records the measured bundle numbers and defers, rather
   than forcing it.
2. **Strict Mode vs. terminal socket cardinality (slice 5).** `docs/react-migration-plan.md:300`
   records an explicit S5 decision *not* to enable Strict Mode because of
   double-effect socket opening. Slice 5 reverses that decision, so it must fix
   the effect first and prove one-socket cardinality, never weaken the test.
3. **Terminal controller extraction (slice 10)** touches the 1,272-line
   `TaskTerminal.tsx`, the highest-risk surface in the app. If clipboard or
   fullscreen ownership cannot move cleanly, extract construction/connection/
   disposal only and continue in separate tested slices.

## Validation gate (every slice)

```bash
npm run web:check
npm run web:test -- --run
npm run web:lint            # from slice 2 onward
npm run web:build:check
npm run web:smoke           # mobile-webkit
cargo nextest run -p ajax-web
npm run verify              # full gate before PR
```

Dev deploy → validate at https://ajaxdev.mossyhome.net:8788 → iPhone checklist.
